-----

Yet another PHP events library as all the others were **not invented here**.

> #### Note: In development (read: unusable)
> It is currently in its **design** phase and therefore considered **unusable**. The API will fluctuate, solar flares will
> appear, wormholes will consume your data, gremlins will chase your cat. You've been warned.
