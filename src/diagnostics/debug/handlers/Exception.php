/**
 * Exception Handler
 *
 * Responsible for handling Exceptions that have not get caught. Inspects them and provides its analyses to
 * registered Delegates {@see interfaces\Delegate}, which could be logging facilities, full page error displays
 * and the likes. All collection-like methods (add, remove, all etc.) manage the delegates and are named this way
 * for simplicity's sake.
 *
 * Delegates (both callables and actual Delegate instances) can be named and referred to by the set name for
 * white-and-black-listing and removal. Check {@see self::add()} and {@see self::set()} for information on the
 * naming behaviour.
