/**
 * Error Handler
 *
 * Converts errors of a severity equal to or above the given threshold into Exceptions for easier inspections
 * and more robust and cohesive handling. Does not modify any of the input data it gets (for instance, error
 * messages are left as is, so the Exception Handler can decide how to present them).
 *
 * Note: The internal error threshold {@see self::setThreshold()} can work decoupled from PHP's error_reporting()
 *       level. For instance, if PHP is set to report all errors but this handler's threshold is set to warnings,
 *       only warnings and higher levels of errors will get converted to exceptions. This handler *does not*
 *       automatically turn off PHP's display_errors ini directive, meaning that under the above circumstances
 *       all errors below warnings might get displayed by PHP's internal error handler unless you set the
 *       directive to 0 yourself.
