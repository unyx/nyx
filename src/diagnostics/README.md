Currently in its infant **design phase** and therefore considered **unusable**. The API will fluctuate, 
solar flares will appear, wormholes will consume your data, gremlins will chase your cat. You've been warned.

The package is loosely coupled and highly flexible, giving you granular control over when and how errors or exceptions 
get thrown, how to handle the aftermath and how to stay in the know with what's happening with your application 
in production.

It is comprised of submodules which can work standalone or in tandem when you glue them together. You can start out
with the most basic setup and make use of more advanced functionality as you go. Things won't happen unless you want
them to.
