![Dev warning](http://s7.postimg.org/6cruwesi3/Nyx.png)

A set set of tools intended to make debugging and profiling your code as simple as possible. It is loosely coupled and
highly flexible, giving you granular control over when and how errors or exceptions get thrown, how to handle the
aftermath and how to stay in the know with what's happening with your application during production.

It is comprised of submodules which can work standalone or in tandem when you glue them together. You can start out
with the most basic setup and make use of more advanced functionality as you go. Things won't happen unless you want
them to.
